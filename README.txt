Wireshark-like Packet Sniffer with AI-based Packet Analysis
Overview
This application is a powerful network packet sniffer inspired by Wireshark, enhanced with AI-driven packet analysis capabilities. It captures and inspects network traffic in real-time, providing advanced insights and detailed visualization to help security professionals, ethical hackers, and network administrators detect anomalies, malware, or suspicious activities efficiently.

Features
Real-time Packet Capturing: Monitors all incoming and outgoing network traffic with high accuracy and minimal latency.

AI-Based Packet Analysis: Utilizes intelligent algorithms to classify, detect anomalies, and identify potential threats within captured packets.

Detailed Packet Inspection: Deep-dive into packet headers and payloads with structured views, making it easy to understand complex network data.

User-Friendly GUI: Clean, intuitive graphical interface with smooth navigation and customizable views.

Custom Filters and Search: Apply advanced filters to isolate traffic based on IP, protocol, port, or custom rules.

Multi-Protocol Support: Handles a wide range of network protocols including TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and more.

Export & Reporting: Save capture sessions and generate comprehensive reports for audits and further analysis.

Lightweight and Efficient: Optimized to run smoothly on standard systems without significant resource overhead.

Installation
The application is distributed as a standalone executable file. To use it:

Download the latest release executable from the official source.

Place the executable in your preferred directory.

Run the application by double-clicking the executable.

No additional dependencies or installations are required.

Usage
Launch the Application: Open the executable to start the packet sniffer GUI.

Select Network Interface: Choose the network adapter you want to monitor from the dropdown menu.

Start Capturing: Click the 'Start Capture' button to begin monitoring network traffic.

Analyze Traffic: View live packets as they are captured with detailed breakdowns.

Apply Filters: Use the filter bar to narrow down the traffic to specific IP addresses, protocols, or ports.

Inspect Packets: Click on any packet to see in-depth details, including headers and payload data.

Export Data: Save capture sessions or export analysis reports via the ‘Export’ menu.

Stop Capture: Click the 'Stop Capture' button to end the session safely.

Security and Privacy
The application requires elevated permissions to capture network traffic.

All captured data is processed locally; no external transmission occurs.

Use responsibly and only on networks where you have permission to monitor traffic.

This tool is intended strictly for ethical hacking, network analysis, and educational purposes.

Troubleshooting
If the application fails to start or capture packets, ensure that it is running with sufficient permissions.

Some network interfaces may not support packet capturing due to driver limitations.

Consult the logs located in the application directory for detailed error messages.

Restart the application if you encounter freezes or UI issues.
